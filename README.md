# Lazer-Defender
A classic old space shooter made using Unity. 

The player will be represented by a spaceship and can move left or right within the
playspace and can also shoot projectiles upwards towards the oncoming enemies.

The game will have multiple levels with each level getting progressively harder than
the previous ones in terms of types and number of enemies that the player faces.

Each enemy destroyed will earn the player some points.
